# PrecisionTrade: Risk & Position Size Calculator 🚀

A professional-grade desktop application built with **Electron**, specifically engineered for leveraged cryptocurrency traders to execute rigorous capital preservation and position sizing strategies.

## 📌 Project Overview

**PrecisionTrade** was developed to solve a critical need in high-leverage trading: the necessity for instant, error-free risk calculations. Originally created as a bespoke tool for my personal trading desk, this app eliminates manual calculation errors and helps traders adhere to a strict trading plan.

Instead of guessing your margin or liquidation point, you can now input your parameters and immediately receive the exact data required for institutional-grade risk management.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Dynamic Position Sizing:** Calculate exact contract sizes based on your account equity and the specific percentage of capital you are willing to risk per trade.
* **Leverage & Margin Optimization:** Real-time visualization of how leverage adjustments impact your required margin and liquidation proximity.
* **Multi-Tier Take Profit (TP) Engine:** Map out complex exit strategies with multiple targets while tracking your overall Risk/Reward (R/R) ratio.
* **Stop-Loss Invalidation Logic:** Clear data on your maximum drawdown for every setup before you hit 'buy' or 'sell'.
* **Low-Latency Performance:** As a dedicated Electron desktop app, it provides a distraction-free environment that is always accessible alongside your trading terminal.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

* **Framework:** Electron (Cross-platform Desktop Integration)
* **Core:** Node.js, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
